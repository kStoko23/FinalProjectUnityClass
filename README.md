# FinalProjectUnityClass
Final project for my Uni Unity3D class.
It's a remake of a game called Space Invaders, but in 3D.

# Final thoughts
This project was made on a tight schedule and was purely for getting a grade.
The theme and what the game was supposed to be about was chosen by our professor.
If I was to do it all over, I would absolutely do things diffrent. I probably wouldn't try to do Space Invaders remake.
With all that in mind, I've learned few things along the way, mainly what not to do and how to structure your project so you can find your way around it someday.
My script management (naming, assigning, spliting simple functions to diffrent script) was at first good idea, but turned out to cause more problems than it helped.
Me menu could also use some polishing (or a total rebuild) when I look at it now. Not that I don't like it's look, but the way I implemented it and how little functions 
I made really bothers me.
I had fun doing this project overall, learned a lot and discovered few things that I want to know more about.
