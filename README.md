# FinalProjectUnityClass

This repository contains a 3D game created in Unity as a final project for a university class on game development. The game demonstrates various aspects of Unity development, including level design, character animation, scripting, and audio implementation. For this purpose I chose to remake a well-known game Space Invaders and made it 3D.

## Overview

The game features a 3D character with a goal of eliminating bunch of enemies while trying to not get destroyed by them. The project is designed to showcase core Unity concepts and serve as a learning resource for other aspiring game developers.

## Features
- A basic level, with the goal to beat all enemies before they end you. 
- Music & sound effects
- Fully funcional UI
